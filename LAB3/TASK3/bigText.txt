Risk assessment with impact valuation involves not only identifying and analyzing potential risks but also quantifying their potential impact in terms of various factors such as financial loss, human health and safety, environmental damage, reputation damage, and regulatory compliance.
The potential impact of each identified risk is quantified in measurable terms. For example, financial impacts may be assessed in terms of potential revenue loss, cost of damages, or insurance premiums. Human health and safety impacts may be quantified in terms of potential injuries, illnesses, or fatalities. Environmental impacts may be assessed in terms of pollution levels, habitat destruction, or resource depletion. Reputation impacts may be quantified in terms of damage to brand image or customer trust. Regulatory compliance impacts may be assessed in terms of fines, penalties, or legal liabilities.
